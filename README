NAME
    README - Slash Readme

WARNING
    This release of Slash is PRERELEASE software. Run at your own risk.
    There may be bugs, and documentation is not yet finished or wrong. We
    feel this release is stable for production use, as we use it on
    http://slashcode.com/, but it may have more problems than one would
    expect from a final release.

DESCRIPTION
    Slash -- Slashdot Like Automated Storytelling Homepage -- is the code
    that runs Slashdot. More than that, however, Slash is an architecture
    for putting together web sites. It comes with functionality for posting
    articles, conducting polls, having discussions, and more. But it can be
    extended in innumerable ways.

    Slash is written in Perl, and is built on top of Apache and mod_perl. It
    requires a database backend, though the only well-supported database
    used with it is MySQL (more databases will become well-supported as time
    goes on; PostgreSQL support is already well on its way). Slash is fast,
    scalable, and secure (as evidenced by one of the best test cases you
    could have, running Slashdot itself).

    Through a plugin system, developers can add functionality to Slash.
    Through themes and templates (which are written using Template Toolkit),
    the look and feel of a Slash site can be customized.

    See INSTALL for information about installing Slash, including hardware
    and software requirements. Read that document carefully, and follow the
    instructions as precisely as possible.

    Also see INSTALL for information on upgrading from previous versions of
    Slash.

    As noted in the FAQ, please send any bug reports, and subscribe to
    mailing lists, at Slash's SourceForge site.

DOCUMENTATION
    The .pod documentation included with Slash can be read with the
    `perldoc' program, included with perl, or translated using one of the
    many `pod2*' translators.

    The documentation is also available online on the Slash FAQ.
