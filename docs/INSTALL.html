<P>INSTALL - Slash Installation</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</A></H1>
<P>This document describes how to install Slash 2.0
(code-named "bender").  For instructions on installation
of previous versions of Slash, see the INSTALL document
included with those distributions.</P>
<P>These instructions have only been tested on Linux. Installation under
BSD and other Unix OSes should work similarly. We've had reports of the
1.0.x version of Slash running on Windows, but have done no testing and
have no further information.</P>
<P>PostgreSQL support in Slash 2.0 is currently alpha-quality,
while MySQL support is beta-quality.</P>
<P>Slash can always be downloaded from SourceForge, and from the
Slashdot FTP site.</P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/slashcode/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/slashcode/</A>
        <A HREF="ftp://ftp.slashdot.org//pub/slash/">ftp://ftp.slashdot.org//pub/slash/</A></PRE>
<P>The CVS repository (http://cvs.slashcode.com/) is tagged with version
numbers, so to get release 1.0.3, use tag "v1_0_3_0".  The last number
(in this case a zero) will be incremented during development
("v1_0_3_1", "v1_0_3_2", etc.) until the next release.</P>
<P>The software and hardware requirements are listed at the end of the
document, because we know you want to get right into the installation.</P>

<P>Read all of this section before doing any of it.</P>
<P>The first thing to do is to, as per the instructions below under
INSTALLATION, unpack the latest distribution and run make and make
install with the proper arguments.</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Overwriting_Changes">Overwriting Changes</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This process will overwrite any customizations of your installed
modules, or customizations of the installed scripts in
/usr/local/slash/themes/ and /usr/local/slash/plugins/ (for themes
and plugins that come with Slash).  If you ran install-slashsite
with the default option of using symlinks, and made customizations
to the originals instead of breaking the symlink and copying the file
over, then this will overwrite your changes.
<P>If you did modify the original instead of a copy, then break the
symlink, copy over the original (as modified), and then continue.
The original will be copied over by the new version, and your modified
copy will remain intact.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Templates">Templates</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
With every update, there are changes to templates.  But most people
will modify their templates.  A relatively simple way to see what
has changed is to use template-tool and template-check.  This
procedure should help most users deal with the integration of new
templates into an existing site (it will only work with the slashcode
theme, but a simple modification to the code of template-check
can fix that).
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Dump">Dump</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Use template-tool to dump your templates into an empty directory.
<PRE>
        % mkdir templates
        % cd templates
        % template-tool -u VIRTUAL_USER -d</PRE>
<P>(Defaults to current directory.)</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Compare">Compare</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Use template-check to compare installed templates in
/usr/local/slash/themes/slashcode/ and /usr/local/slash/plugins/ against
the templates that have been dumped.
<PRE>
        % template-check -u VIRTUAL_USER</PRE>
<P>(Defaults to current directory.)</P>
<P>This will use diff to show you the differences.  You can either go
into the templates with a text editor (in another window) and change
the dumped ones by hand, edit them by hand in the Template Editor
via the web browser, or take a note of every template you want to
copy over your existing template.</P>
<P>After each directory of templates is done, hit "q" to continue to
the next plugin/theme.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Sync">Sync</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
If you made changes by hand via the web, you are done.  Otherwise, take
the list of templates to update, and pass the full filenames to
template-tool (this will either be the templates you modified by hand
in the dump directory, or the unmodified ones in the installation
directories). You might need to put each filename in quotes because of
the ";" character in the filenames.  This will overwrite your existing
template with the new template.
<PRE>
        % template-tool -u VIRTUAL_USER -s LIST</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="slash_1.0___slash_2.0">Slash 1.0 -&gt; Slash 2.0</A></H2>
<P>Please read the complete documentation of <EM>utils/slash1toslash2</EM>.
It is a program that will convert your database from Slash 1.0
to a new Slash 2.0 database.  The program documentation (which can
be read with <EM>perldoc</EM>) details exactly what process it follows
to do the conversion, so you can attempt to do it by hand if you
prefer.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation">INSTALLATION</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="installation_notes">Installation Notes</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>
For slashd (see <EM>utils/slash</EM>, which starts slashd),
mod_perl (see <EM>httpd/httpd.conf</EM>), and MySQL, we set all processes
to run in GMT.  Then it is easy to convert dates to whatever the
user's local time is.  If you have date offset problems, check that all of
these are properly set to run in GMT.
<P></P>
<LI>
You cannot have different versions of the Slash modules installed for
different sites on the same Apache server.  Well, if you want to, you
can try the Apache::PerlVINC module, but this is <STRONG>not</STRONG> recommended for
performance reasons. Slash is designed to have one shared core of code
for all Slash sites on a system.  (This is made easier than it was in
1.0.x, where to customize a site, you needed to change the module code;
this should no longer be necessary.)
<P></P>
<LI>
All of the installation steps below should be executed as root.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="installation_procedure">Installation Procedure</A></H2>
<P>There are six steps to installation.  Skip the parts you already
have installed (making sure you have the correct versions).  Make sure
to read the special note about Apache / mod_perl installation.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install MySQL.</STRONG>
<P>Please refer to MySQL documentation for compilation
and/or installation notes for any questions with this process.  Find
the script that runs mysql (probably <EM>safe_mysqld</EM>) and add these
lines to the beginning of it:</P>
<PRE>
        TZ=GMT
        export TZ</PRE>
<P>Create a database to be used by Slash.</P>
<P>Create a username/password that can access that database (by
default, we normally set the user to have all permissions, but that
might not be appropriate for your site).</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install perl.</STRONG>
<P>perl is likely already installed on your machine; make sure its
version is 5.005_03 or better.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install Apache and mod_perl.</STRONG>
<P><STRONG>You MUST install mod_perl and Apache as directed here</STRONG>.  OK, that is
not strictly true, but it is <EM>mostly</EM> true.  If you already have mod_perl
installed, it is probably not configured properly to work with Slash
and you will have to rebuild it.  [If you are using the provided httpd.conf
file from the slash distribution, and find that Apache is giving you errors,
chances are mod_perl is not installed correctly, and you need to build it
from scratch.]  Of course, if you have your own Apache modules or build
options, you will need to modify the instructions here appropriately.</P>
<P>First, untar apache and mod_perl.  Then, go to the mod_perl directory,
and have mod_perl build and install apache for you:</P>
<PRE>
        perl Makefile.PL APACHE_SRC=/where_you_have_the_source DO_HTTPD=1 \
                USE_APACI=1 PERL_MARK_WHERE=1 EVERYTHING=1 \
                APACHE_PREFIX=/where_apache_will_be_installed
        make
        make test
        make install</PRE>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install the Perl modules.</STRONG>
<P>The best way to do this is with the CPAN module.</P>
<P>With older versions of the CPAN module, the module will try to
download and install the latest version of Perl.  Watch what
the module is doing; if it begins to download an entire perl
distribution, hit ctrl-C until it stops, then try again with the
CPAN module.  (Hopefully, the new CPAN module will have been installed
by this point in the process.  If not, try installing the latest
CPAN module by hand, and then repeat the process.)</P>
<P>Sometimes, you will be installing a newer version of a module that
exists elsewhere on the system.  You might want to tell the CPAN module
to automatically remove older files.  To do that from the CPAN shell,
type:</P>
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; o conf make_install_arg UNINST=1</PRE>
<P>You might also wish to install each module by hand, using distributions
found on the CPAN.  See <A HREF="http://perldoc.com/m?perlmodinstall">http://perldoc.com/m?perlmodinstall</A>
for more information on installing perl modules.</P>
<P><STRONG>Important Notes</STRONG>:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
You must have certain libraries existing on your system before
building, for Compress::Zlib and XML::Parser.  See <A HREF="#perl">perl</A>.
<P></P>
<LI>
If running BSD, also install the BSD::Resource module.
<P></P>
<LI>
If not using MySQL, just allow the installation of its drivers
to continue, and possibly fail.  Then install the driver you need
(e.g., for PostgreSQL, use "DBD::Pg") using the CPAN shell.
<P></P></UL>
<P>To use the CPAN module, invoke the CPAN shell:</P>
<PRE>
        perl -MCPAN -e shell</PRE>
<P>After it has been configured, install Bundle::Slash:</P>
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; install Bundle::Slash</PRE>
<P>To read the README for any module, before or after installing:</P>
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; readme MODULE</PRE>
<P>When Bundle::Slash is finished, install the DBIx::Password
module:</P>
<PRE>
        cpan&gt; install DBIx::Password</PRE>
<P>When asked, give the info for accessing the Slash database created
in step 1.  This is your <STRONG>virtual user</STRONG> information; it is a single
name that is used to refer to a configuration for connecting to your
database.</P>
<P>If you have problems, feel free to re-run "install Bundle::Slash".  It
will safely skip anything already installed.</P>
<P>To read the documentation of any of the modules, once they have been
installed, type "perldoc MODULE" at the command line.</P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install Slash.</STRONG>
<P>Unpack the distribution and go to the new directory that
creates, and type:</P>
<PRE>
        make
        make install</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: this depends on a relatively new version of the <STRONG>install</STRONG>
program that comes with GNU fileutils distribution.  Version 4.0 is
recommended.  Some older versions of SuSE, for example, come with
version 3; just install the latest fileutils package, or version 4.0
of install.</P>
<P>There are a few options to <CODE>make</CODE> and <CODE>make install</CODE> you may
want to change.</P>
<PRE>
        option          default                 purpose
        ==========================================================
        SLASH_PREFIX    /usr/local/slash        Location for
                                                installed files
        INIT            /etc or /etc/rc.d       Location for init
                                                scripts
        USER            nobody                  User to own files
        GROUP           nobody                  Group to own files</PRE>
<P>(USER and GROUP will also be changed later on a per-site basis,
in step 6. while running <EM>install-slashsite</EM>.)</P>
<P>So, for example, you might type (although the default SLASH_PREFIX
is _strongly_ recommended):</P>
<PRE>
        make SLASH_PREFIX=/home/slash
        make install SLASH_PREFIX=/home/slash</PRE>
<P>When done, a configuration file for Apache will be created at
<EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM>.  You can put its contents into your
httpd.conf, or you can just <CODE>Include</CODE> it in your httpd.conf.</P>
<P><STRONG>WARNING!</STRONG></P>
<P>Please be aware that if you include <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM>
or <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/sites/sitename/sitename.conf</EM> more than once,
or if this file shares contents with directives in httpd.conf,
that your Slash site WILL break. The directives in
<EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM> should be run only ONCE in any any
site context.  Read through <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/slash.conf</EM> to make
sure it all looks proper.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Install your Slash site.</STRONG>
<P>Go to your installation directory (by default, <EM>/usr/local/slash</EM>)
and execute (where <CODE>VIRTUAL_USER</CODE> is the name of the virtual
user given in the DBIx::Password distribution):</P>
<PRE>
        bin/install-slashsite VIRTUAL_USER</PRE>
<P>The program will prompt for answers to several configuration questions.
Answer the questions.  When done, another configuration
file will be created at <EM>$SLASH_PREFIX/$SITENAME/$SITENAME.conf</EM>.
You can put its contents unto your httpd.conf, or you can just <CODE>Include</CODE>
it in your httpd.conf.</P>
<P>Read the message printed at the end of running install_slashsite.</P>
<P></P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Start it up.</STRONG>
<P>After installation of the site is done, and Apache has been stopped
and started (do NOT try to restart Apache, but do a full stop and
start), run slashd.  This should be done via the init script:</P>
<PRE>
        /etc/init.d/slash start</PRE>
<P>slashd is the daemon that runs routine maintenance on Slash sites,
including sending out daily mailings, cleaning up the database,
and updating stories.  The init script above will start up an
individual slashd daemon process process for each installed site.</P>
<P></P></OL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="installation_options">INSTALLATION OPTIONS</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="multiple_servers">Multiple Servers</A></H2>
<P>You can, of course, have a separate database server from your Slash
server.  Further, you can have multiple web servers for one Slash site.
Slashdot, for instance, has one primary server with all of the code
(Apache, perl, etc.), and it runs slashd and NFS.  Each
web server then mounts the code read-only over NFS.  Some notes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Make sure the MySQL server allows the user to log in from each web
server, and the NFS server.
<P></P>
<LI>
Make sure, if you use the same httpd tree on all machines, that
the httpd.conf is listening to the proper IP addresses.  This can be
done by putting all of the IP addresses in the conf file, or by having
a separate Listen file on each machine.  Similarly, make sure that
each web server's logfiles unique to each machine, not written to the
NFS volumes.
<P></P></UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="virtual_hosts">Virtual Hosts</A></H2>
<P>Slash has support for virtual hosts, so you can have multiple
Slash sites on one machine.  Simply execute step 6 in the install
process for each Slash site (after adding a new virtual user to
DBIx::Password for each).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ssl">SSL</A></H2>
<P>In Slash, there are two variables for the root URL of the site.
<STRONG>absolutedir</STRONG> is the full URL, including protocol, while <STRONG>rootdir</STRONG>
is the URL without protocol:</P>
<PRE>
        absolutedir     <A HREF="http://slashcode.com">http://slashcode.com</A>
        rootdir         //slashcode.com</PRE>
<P><STRONG>absolutedir</STRONG> is used only for creating external links to the site
(such as in RSS files).  <STRONG>rootdir</STRONG> is used for internal links; that
way, you can use the same HTML pages for SSL and non-SSL.  You don't
have to do anything special to the code or preferences to allow it to
work with SSL by itself, SSL and non-SSL together, or non-SSL by itself.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="nonroot">Non-Root</A></H2>
<P>It is possible to install and run everything here without root.</P>
<P>Describing the process for a non-root install would take up significant
space and time, having to account for differences in various systems,
and all the workarounds necessary for it to work.</P>
<P>If you must have a non-root install, consult the various documentation
for Apache, MySQL, and perl about running and installing without root
access.  Then, for Slash, you simply need to set the make variables PREFIX,
SLASH_PREFIX, and INIT appropriately for your needs.</P>
<P><STRONG>Note</STRONG>: Slash (or, more accurately, Apache + mod_perl and MySQL) take
up a lot of system resources.  It is <EM>not advisable</EM> for anyone to
run Slash at all on a system, without the permission of the administrator
of that system.</P>

<P>There are no specific hardware requirements.  Apache (with mod_perl) and
MySQL both take up a lot of RAM; running a complete system with 128MB
might be possible, if you do some tuning of the configuration, but a
practical minimum 256MB is recommended, though less could be sufficient
with some tuning.Storage space depends on how busy you expect the site
to be; 250MB is possible, but a minimum 1GB is recommended.  Necessary
processor speed is also dependent on how busy the site is; Pentium 133
or equivalent might work, but less than a Pentium II/200 is not
recommended.</P>
<P>For the curious, Slashdot (as of January 2001) runs on eight machines:
six webservers (each is Pentium III/600, 1GB RAM, 9GB hard drive), one
NFS server (dual PIII/600, 2GB RAM, 2 x 9GB hard drive), and one
database server (quad Xeon/550, 2GB RAM, 6 x 9GB hard drive).  However,
this is certainly overkill for most sites (and possibly even overkill
for Slashdot).</P>
