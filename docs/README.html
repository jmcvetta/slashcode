README - Slashdot Readme

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
This is the README file for Slash, release 1.0.8. Please read all
documentation carefully. The various documents explain the database schema,
the various fields in the database, and some of the reasoning behind the
design of the schema, installation and setup.

<P>
Please see <EM>INSTALL</EM> for database upgrade instructions. Code upgrading is simple: use the new
code in the new distribution, and make sure that you have the new values
and configurations in your copies of
<EM>slashdotrc.pl</EM> and <EM>httpd.conf</EM>. If you neglect to upgrade these last two, your site likely will not work.

<P>
Also, double-check every line of <EM>CHANGES</EM> to see if anything has changed to affect your site (like a change from
Mail::Sender to Mail::Sendmail, for example).

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>: This page looks best in a browser (the HTML version of it is in the <EM>docs/</EM> directory). You can print it out, but some of the ASCII illustrations may
get munged in printing, but the directions will certainly appear good
enough to read.

<P>
We have a preliminary Getting Started document at
<EM>public_html/getting_started.shtml</EM>. If this is your first time with Slash, or you have questions or problems
getting started, look here first.

<P>
See the Slash web site, with support, docs, latest downloads, FAQs, and
more, at &lt;URL:http://slashcode.com/&gt;.

<P>
This release is tagged in CVS as v1_0_8_0. See the SourceForge site at &lt;<A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/slashcode/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/slashcode/</A>
&gt; for CVS, bug reporting, patch submissions, and downloads.

Maybe this is a dumb question, but why not get this answered? Slash is a
database-driven news and message board, using mod_perl and MySQL. It has
been programmed, more so recently, to use persistance for a good deal of
its variables to increase speed and efficiency. Slash has all the features
and more that you'd ever want in a bulletin-board/message-board system. You
can customize it to anything you want, give it any appearance that you
want. This can mostly be done via data. Slash is a database beast in the
true sense. The Slash code is distributed under the GNU General Public
License (see <EM>COPYING</EM>).

The live Slashdot used five separate servers for its high hit count. This
is not a target number for all Slash sites. You can run all of Slash on one
server, or throw it on 20 servers. The more load you want it to handle, the
more hardware you'll want. Slash consists of three main parts: database,
codebase, and web server. How those are divvied up amongst servers is up to
your own creative planning. Slash runs on Linux but is not Linux specific.
Whatever runs Apache/mod_perl and MySQL will run Slash. Slash does have
some MySQL-specific SQL statements contained within, but it's not entirely
impossible to run it on another RDBMS with some modifications.

Please read the various documents that come with the Slash code (in
<EM>docs/</EM>). There's a lot of information that can give you a better idea of what the
code does, how to install the code, and other information on the database
schema.
