This is a mathematical toy, not meant to be installed on production
websites.  It serves primarily as sample code to demonstrate how to
write a plugin with all the major components:  SQL schema, SQL data,
templates, slashd task, and frontend webpage script.

This code doesn't really do anything yet.  It uses the Safe module
but of course don't put any perl code into your DB that shouldn't
be executed.  Use at your own risk.
