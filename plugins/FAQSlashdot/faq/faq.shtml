<P><A name="Q0"><H2>Who does this?</h2>
Check out <A href=about.shtml>the About page</A> to read about
me and the rest of the gang that make this keep happening each day.

<P><A name="Q1"><H2>Why aren't these FAQs answered yet?</h2>
Hey!  I'm a busy guy.  If I spent all my time answering FAQs then I wouldn't
have any time left to work on projects that you guys will frequently
ask questions about.  Read these before ya email me and save me the time to
write the email, and you the time to wait for it.

<P><A name="Q2"><H2>Why didn't you post my story?</H2>
On a normal day, we can get 150-200 article submissions.  Typically we
post 8 to 12 of them.  Also, Since we post the first submission (unless
we screw up- it happens occasionally) yours may have just been 2nd.  Or
37th.  Or else we posted it a few weeks ago and you're late.   Or we may not just have
found your article interesting enough.  Either way, we've gotta reject  10
times more then we post, so please understand.

<P><A name="Q3"><H2>Why doesn't Slashdot display in Browser X?</H2>
We've tested many versions of Netscape, Lynx and IE with Slashdot.  You
will need at least NS3, Lynx 2.7.2 or IE4 to make Slashdot work.  Please Don't
ask me to change x, y, or z to make Netscape 1.1 work, but if changing x y or
z will make a <B>relevant</B> version of a browser work, feel free to ask.  
I may not be able to make the change for whatever reason, but if its something
simple, just send me an example of what's wrong, and ideally, what needs to
be done to fix it.  Don't just say "WebMeisterOMatic v2.9 doesn't Render
Slashdot".  I don't have WebMeisterOMatic v2.9.  But if you tell me that
it's because I forgot to close a table, well then I have a reasonable
chance of fixing it.

<P><A name="Q4"><H2>How can I advertise on Slashdot?</H2>
<A href=mailto:billd@andover.net>Bill</A> is the advertising 
guy at Andover.  Email him and ask for the Slashdot Rate card.

<P><A name="Q5"><H2>What distribution do you use?</H2>
I started with Slackware years ago.  These days I use 
<A href=http://www.debian.org/>Debian</A> on my servers and
personal boxes.  New users should start
with Red Hat.  Advanced users should consider Debian, especially if they
are familiar with Unix already.  Nobody should use Slackware unless they
are used to it already.  SuSE is also popular, and CowboyNeal used to
swear on it, although he uses Debian now.
I'm not familiar enough with the other distributions to speak
fairly for them, and frankly, my love affair with Debian shows no signs
of waning any time soon.

<P><A name="Q6"><H2>I have a cool story that Slashdot should post, what do I
do?</H2>
Check out <A href=/submit.pl>the contrib form</A>.  If you fill out that
form, it gets formatted nicely and shipped off to the submissions box for evaluation,
editing, deleting, and possibly even posting.

<P><A name="Q7"><H2>I want to write a feature, what should I do?</H2>
<A href=mailto:malda@slashdot.org>Email me</A> and tell me about your
topic.  Or send me a summary.  I like to know what people are working on so
we don't have overlap, and if you send me stuff early, I can possibly help
you with ideas.

<P><A name="Q8"><H2>Why is your grammar/spelling so bad?</H2>
'cuz I ain't no english guy.  I'm a coder and cartoonist and a pretty decent
graphic designer, but I can count my english credits on my left hand.  I do my
darndest be clear and concise, and in just a paragraph or two.  Ten times a
day.  Every day.  And I'm a flawed impatient human being, so I make mistakes
sometimes. If a mistake bugs ya, feel free to email me.

<P><A name="Q9"><H2>What is powering the show?</A></H2>
As it stands we're running off a cluster of boxes hosted at 
<A href=http://www.exodus.net>Exodus.Net</A>.  There are 4 dedicated
ad/image boxes (P3/600), and a dedicated
<A href=http://www.mysql.com>MySQL</A> box (4-way P3/550).  Then there
are 6 http boxes that are fed requests from an Arrowpoint Load Balancer.
All the boxes run <A href=http://www.debian.org>Debian</A> because it
its my favorite distribution (No holy wars here please!)

The web server is <A href=http://www.apache.org>Apache</A> as the web
server, and Slashdot itself is a combination of
<A href=http://www.perl.org>Perl</A> and <A href=http://www.mysql.com>MySQL</A>.
It runs under <A href=http://perl.apache.org>mod_perl</A> to keep things
moving.

<P>The source code to Slashdot is called "Slash" (the Slashdot-Like Automatic
Storytelling Homepage) and is released whenever I have some time to make a tarball
(read:Not very often).  You can learn more about the source code by
reading <A href=/code.shtml>the Slash page</A>.  Any time anyone asks me
when I'm releasing a new tarball, I delay the release by 24 hours *grin*
it will be released again when I'm ready.

<P><A name="Q11"><H2>Why did you post X?</H2>
Well, I do my best guys, and I certainly make mistakes, but for
the most part I think I do pretty well.  I've posted thousands
articles, and if 2 or 3 a week don't seem right, well
that's still pretty good odds.  Besides, if you don't like it, that
doesn't mean everyone hates it.  Slashdot isn't just Linux News,
its 'News for Nerds' and I try to fulfill
that- often this means linux, but that doesn't mean that I won't
mention <A href=http://www.starwars.com>Star Wars</A> or something 
if I think it's cool.  And as far other silly side stuff (Mugs?  T-Shirts?  CD Now CDs?) just remember that silly stuff like that makes me a happy Rob.  A happy
Rob posts articles faster and more often and replies to his email
and passes stats.

<P><A name="Q12"><H2>Where/Why do you use Cookies?</H2>
We use cookies to remember who you are.  If you are
paranoid about cookies, then you probably don't understand them.
They aren't mind control or
voodoo so relax and accept them without fealing like
Big Brother is watching every time you see a cookie... without
them, the internet woudl have a lot more problems than it already
does.  If you don't believe me, tough.  I'm firm on this one:
Cookies aren't perfect, but they aren't evil, and I'll continue
to use them.

<P><A name="Q13"><H2>Why did my comment get Deleted?</H2>
It probably didn't.  It probably just got moderated down by the
army of moderators.  Try browsing at a lower threshold and see if
your comment becomes visible.

<P><A name="Q14"><h2>Why did it take so long for my comment to appear?</h2>
A daemon refreshes pages in 60 seconds... that takes a few seconds.  If
it takes longer than that, either your cache is screwed up, or
our code is wrong.  But we have 38,000+ comments in the database
at any given time, and they worked just fine.  If it doesn't appear
after a few minutes, feel free to ask.  Course, if it was a stupid
comment, it might be gone :)

<P><A name="Q15"><h2>What's up with Flat/Threaded Comments?</h2>
Threaded are cooler.  They let you actually see conversations
clearly.  Flattened are bigger, but you can read them off line.
They kinda lose context at points though cuz they're ordered by
time instead of thread.  I've toyed with other ways of doing 
this and soon I'm going to try a new layout or 2 and see what
people think.  The current version is not ideal yet for my
tastes.  And I Hate Flat Mode *grin*. 
<P>If you have a  user account, you can edit your preferences
to choose between flat, threaded, nested, and no comments mode.
Its spiffy.

<P><A name="Q16"><H2>I would like Slashdot to... </H2>
If its not something addressed on the FAQ, try emailing
<A href=mailto:pater@slashdot.org>CowboyNeal</A> or 
<A href=mailto:malda@slashdot.org>CmdrTaco</A>.  Please read
this whole FAQ very carefully before you bug us because many
of the more common feature requests are already discussed in
this document.  (Or, if it involves moderation, in the
<A href=/moderation.shtml>Moderation Docs</A>)


<P><A name="Q17"><h2>I found a bug! Where should I report it?</h2>
Check out our current <A href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=4421">bug list/report form</A> at <A href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge.net</A>.


<P><A name="Q20"><H2>Have you considered PHP?</H2>
Yeah I've thought about it.  I used it a little bit in ages past, but have
since grown very fond of Perl.  And since I have a fairly sizable amount
of code already written, most of which I am fond of, I probably won't be
starting over in the immediate future.


<P><A name="Q21"><H2>What about First Posters?</H2>
There are a thousand ways we could <I>try</I> to stop the lame crap that
people seem to want to post on Slashdot.  Meept,  First Post, and some
of the more obvious troll bait is just part of the crap that we get to deal with.
If you are posting this stuff, just stop, it's a waste of everyone's time.
As for solutions, we've talked about many.  Among the best are
<OL>  
<LI>Not allowing Anonymous posts first - I don't want to restrict AC posts
    any more than we do already.  This seems like an unfair restrction to me.
<LI>Reversing the order of comments - Conversation tends to flow forward,
    so simply reversing the comment order would make things confusing.  Besides,
    then we'd have a Last Post Problem.
<LI>Randomize the first few posts - This doesn't eliminate the problem.  The
    first post messages would still <B>be</B> there.  They are annoying.
</OL>
So what to do?  Careful moderation or upping the standard page threshold to require
more points than a default anonymous post gets.  If it continues to be a problem,
that will probably happen.


<P><H2><A name="Q22">Comment posts are getting crappy, what are you doing about it?</A></H2>

Basically we are trying to moderate as best we can, removing spam, troll posts,
first posts, offtopic stuff.  The moderation system doesn't delete anything, it
just marks it down, so people can choose how much they want to read, or not 
read.  A better description of the moderation system can be read on the
<A href=/moderation.shtml>moderator guidelines page</A>. 


<P><H2><A name="Q23">What about Mirroring, Distributing, Proxying or Caching Slashdot?</A></H2>
Mirroring will be a feature in a future version of Slash.  A distributed Slashdot could
take a zillion forms, and I've worked out several ways that it could potentially
be done.  As it stands, I don't have time to implement it.  Maybe someday.  As for
most other suggestions, they usually revolve around expensive hardware that we can't afford,
so they simply aren't an option.


<P><H2><A name="Q24">Have you considered rewriting Slashdot in C?</A></H2>
I've considered it, but not for very long.  Sure, Perl is slower/less efficient that
C, but its high level string manipulation make a lot of things really easy, that
in C would hurt.  A lot.  Besides, mod_perl is compiling my scripts already- sure,
its compiled to perl form, but thats not all that bad.  Especially considering
that writing a lot of this stuff in C would be a ton of code.  

<P><H2><A name="Q25">Why are you generating so many pages Dynamically?</A></H2>
We're really not generating that many pages dynamically.  The homepage, the
section indexes, and the articles are all generated and stored for users as
updates occur.  These pages represent 50-60% of the sites total traffic.
The only pages that are generated dynamically are the comments pages.  These
are dynamic for several reasons:
<OL>
<LI>They change a lot
<LI>The deeper you go, the fewer times the pages are hit
<LI>User preferences and thresholds allow the comments
    to be customized to a users tastes.  The static
    pages ignore those tastes.
</OL>

<P><H2><A name="Q26">Can I have Your Poll Scripts</A></H2>
The poll scripts are part of Slash which is available on 
<A href=http://slashdot.org/code.shtml>The Code Page</A>.
I suspect that there are better polling scripts available if you just
want polling- these polls are tightly integrated with the rest of
Slash to allow nifty things like let users behind firewalls vote
if they are logged in.

<P><H2><A name="Q27">What about the source code to this site?</A></H2>
It's on <A href=http://slashdot.org/code.shtml>The Code Page</A> and its called Slash (The Slashdot-Like
Automated Storytelling Homepage).  The code is GPL, with the tiny
restriction that you must link us back with a Slashdot logo if you
use the code.  v0.2 is pretty raunchy, and pre0.3 has bugs.  But
if I have some freetime, I hope to release v0.4 which is bording on usable.

<H2><A name="Q28">How do I submit questions for "Ask Slashdot?"</A></H2>
You can email your questions to <A href=mailto:askslashdot@slashdot.org>askslashdot@slashdot.org</A>.  Please note that this is not where you want to
report bugs or complain about Slashdot, this is where you want to ask
general questions that the Slashdot readers can try to answer.  If your
question is directed towards Slashdot, you're better off mailing me.
(<A href=mailto:malda@slashdot.org>malda@slashdot.org</A>)

<H2><A name="Q29">How about an NNTP News Gateway?</A></H2>
I'd love to.  But there are 2 problems: Advertising and Time.  I
can't advertise on an NNTP server very easily.  I could possibly
append ads to comments, but that would be really annoying and
not something advertisers would necessarily dig.  Slashdot costs
a lot to run each month, and right now I'm wary of doing this.
<P>The other factor is time.  I don't have time to write the gateway right
now.  But it <B>is</B> on my TODO list.  It'll happen- just not today.
Fortunately someone else has written a Slash/NNTP gateway.  I hope to
have time to look at it soon.


<H2><A name="Q30">How about a page for rejected or pending story 
submissions?</A></H2>
People ask for this a lot, and I've always said no.  Let me try to
list what appears in the 300 or so submissions we get each day:
duplicates of each other (hundred+ each day- a major story will be
submitted 50 or more times), repeats of stories we've posted
days or even months ago (dozens each day).  
Then there is the offensive stuff, the
completely unreadable (anyone who complains about <B>my</B> grammar would
be amazed), stuff with broken HTML that causes netscape to
choke, spam, submissions that
really are meant to be email to an author, feature suggestions, 
bug reports, speculation, rumor, and just plain lies.

<P>Believe
me when I say the submissions box isn't fit for
mainstream consumption.  We work really hard to keep a certain standard up
on Slashdot, and I feel that opening up the submissions bin would be so
prone to abuses, that it would make it much more difficult to maintain.

<P>A "Rejects" pile is reasonable tho with a slim
layer of filtering to prevent abuse and maybe filter out some of the
duplicates.  That'll probably happen someday.

<H2><A name="Q31">How much traffic does Slashdot Serve?</A></H2>
It varies.  We can serve from 600,000 to 800,000 pages on a busy week
day.  Less on weekends.  Millions of pages each month.  10-11 gigs
a day.    If you are logged in, there is a Slashbox that provides a
quick summary of various stats on Slashdot that you might find interesting.


<H2><A name="Q32">How does moderation work?  What are Thresholds?</A></H2>
I really need to write more about this- but you can read the hopelessly
outdated <A href=/moderation.shtml>Moderator Guidelines</A> for a
decent summary.  Basically, moderators are selected from regularly
active users.  Moderators have many checks (a time limit, only a few
points of influence, they aren't allowed to post and moderate the
same discussion) on their power to add and subtract points from scores.
<I>Thresholds</I> are how much you are willing to read on Slashdot.
Anonymous posts start at 0, Logged in Users start at 1.  Moderators
add and remove points.


<H2><A name="Q33">I want a Slashbox that does X</A></H2>
I need
<OL>
 <LI>Permission from someone with authority to grant it
 <LI>A my.netscape style RDF backend (see <A href=/slashdot.rdf>Ours</A>
     for an example).
</OL>
Assuming then that your site is appropriate for Slashdot, email
<A href=mailto:pater@slashdot.org>CowboyNeal</A> and we'll see what we
can do.
 


<H2><A name="Q34">I saw this ad, but I forgot what it was!</A></H2>
We have an index of our advertisers available on
<A href=http://report.andover.net/cgi-bin/ad_current_ads.pl>the advertisers index</A>.  

<H2><A name="Q35">Can I change my Nickname?</A></H2>
No.  I'm afraid that people would abuse the ability to change nicknames,
so I simply don't allow it.  No I won't make an exception because you made a typo. 

<H2><A name="Q36">How about an AvantGo Channel?  Or some other Channel?</A></H2>

A lot of people use 
<A href=http://slashdot.org/index.pl?light=1&noboxes=1>This Url</A> for a
minimal Slashdot view without any cookies or logging in.  This is "No Boxes"
mode, and "Light" mode... you can set either in your preferences if you use
cookies.  As for "Other" channels or whatever you wanna call 'em, you're
probably best of looking at <A href=http://slashdot.org/code.shtml>the
code page</A> and writing a backend for the slashdot.rdf file.  Then you
can do whatever you want, and you don't even need to bother me!


<H2><A name="Q37">Where did the nicknames "CmdrTaco" and "Hemos" come from?</A>
</H2>
Why is that question so important to every friggin reporter that wants to
bother us?  "CmdrTaco" is a reference to a Dave Barry article where he lists
places not to take a date.  Amongst them is any place called "The Commander
Taco" or something like that.  My nickname on my local BBSs was 'Icarus' but
unfortunately when I started using the internet in high school, I found my
name already taken.
<P>"Hemos" is a mangling of a plant found on michigan dunes.  I don't get
it either.  Jeff's a wierd guy.

<H2><A name="Q37.1">Why do reporters care where you nickname comes from?</A></H2>
Frankly I'm not quite sure, but here is my theory: In the real world, people
have names ("Bob", "George", "Archibald") that they are given at birth.  They
are as a general rule quite boring, and uninteresting
<P>Reporters want to get "A Story".  They want to make things interesting.
And if you interview a guy named "Bob" you can't really ask him about his
name ("Yeah, in a past life I was a cork") because he didn't choose it.  But
in the geek world, we tend to pick nicknames for ourselves.
<P>The irony is that most geeks don't hold huge significance to their nicks.
I mean, they are protective of them, and they want it to be unique (there are
a zillion bobs out there, but very few CmdrTaco's... well, except on Quake
servers where apparently there are people who pretend to be me all the time).
Reporters think to themselves "Ooo!  A name like CmdrTaco must be significant
and will allow me to provide a window into this persons soul, when in
reality, whenever a reporter asks me the question, I think, "Shit, this guy
has <I>no</I> clue at all... its just such a formulaic question (along with
"How long have you been doing this" and my personal favorite "What is Slashdot".
<P>So if you're a reporter, don't bother asking geeks about their nicks.
It usually wastes both of our time.


<H2><A name="Q38">How does the moderation system work?</A></H2>
Essentially, moderators are randomly selected from qualified users.  They
are given a limited number of points to sprinkle into the discussions:
By either adding or subtracting points to comments.  A more detailed
description of this simple sounding, but actually fairly complicated
process is available on the <A href=/moderation.shtml>moderator guidelines
page</A>.


<H2><A name="Q40">What is Karma?</A></H2>
This is better explained in the <A href=/moderation.shtml>Moderator Guidelines</A>.  It is largely the sum of all moderation done to your comments, and meta
moderation done to your moderations.

<H2><A name="Q41">Why is my karma not what I expect?</A></H2>
Remember that karma can comes and goes in a variety of ways.  For starters,
when I implented M2, I moved everyone's karma to be within a -30..30 range
(there is nothing holding it there, but I wanted a baseline).   Many people
look at the comments they have posted and don't see anything with a negative
score, but yet they have negative karma.  Remember that Slashdot is only
showing you a few weeks worth of comments on your user info page: that negative
karma could have come from 6 months ago.

<P>It would be nice if we could display some sort of "Karma History" but
I haven't been tracking it for the last 6 months, and I'm not really tracking
it now, so I don't have any real plans to provide that.  Maybe some day if
I get bored and have a spare afternoon.

<H2><A name="Q42">I Forgot/Can't Get my password!</A></H2>
If you are having problems retrieving your password, you can email
<A href=mailto:pater@slashdot.org>CowboyNeal</A>.  Don't
forget to tell him your nickname, and to send it from the account
listed as your "Real Account".

<P>I'm not sure why some people don't seem to get their passwords in the
mail.  It works perfectly for me, but considering the number of people
that say they aren't getting their passwords mailed to them, there must
be some glitches somewhere.


<H2><A name="Q43">Slashdot should Cache linked sites in case of the Slashdot
Effect</A></H2>

<P>Sure, its a great idea, but it has a lot of legal implications.  For example,
commercial sites rely on their banner ads to generate revenue.  If I cache
one of their pages, this will mess with their statistics, and mess with
their banner ads.  In other words, this will piss them off.

<P>Of course, most of the time, the commercial sites that actually have
income from banner ads are able to defend themselves from the Slashdot
effect.  So perhaps we could draw the line at only sites that don't have
ads.  They are, after all, much more likely to buckle under the pressure of all those
unexpected hits.  But what happens if I cache the site, and they update
themselves?  Once again, I'm transmitting data that I shouldn't be.

<P>So the quick answer is: Sure, Caching would be neat.  It would make things
a lot easier when servers go down.  But I'm just not interested in dealing with the legal aspects, or the overhead required to ask permission (and do
you really want Slashdot stories to wait 10 hours while I wait for a reply
from someone in charge of a website to ask if its ok if I cache their
server?).  I wouldn't want people to cache Slashdot without asking my 
permission, so it seems only fair that I don't cache others either.


<H2><A name="Q44">Whenever I use my +1 Bonus, I get moderated down and
                        lose Karma!</A></H2>
<P>Isn't that great?  The system works <B>exactly</B> how I intended it.
   Ya see, as a poster acquires higher karma, they earn with that the
   honor of posting with a "Bonus Point".  Starting their comment at
   Score:2.  Its a reward for being a good contributor to Slashdot.  It
   means that your comments will stand out above the others.

<P>But it also bears more responsibility.  A Score:2 comment will be seen
   by more people.  It will be scrutinized by more moderators.  And just
   because <B>you</B> think it deserves that bonus point doesn't mean that
   other people will.  In other words, when you use your bonus point, you
   put that comment into the spotlight, and open yourself up to the risk
   of losing some karma because of it.

<P>What this means is that a good poster will need to learn when he ought
   to use his bonus point.  Certainly not every time.  I mean, a 'Me Too!'
   comment certainly isn't worthy of that extra bonus.  And what that means
   is that if you consistantly choose to use that bonus point, you will
