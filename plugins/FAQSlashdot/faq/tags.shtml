<h2>What is this crazy tags thing?</h2>
<p> Slashdot is currently experimenting with tagging articles.  You are
encouraged to use this feature to submit a handful of tags: brief labels
that you think best describe this article.  You might choose to say that
this is an article about 'security' and 'mozilla'.
</p>

<p>This is all very beta. Currently tagging is <b>only open to
subscribers.</b></p>

<p>We don't know exactly how this will all work, and a lot of it really
depends on you.  If you choose to add your own tags, be aware:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your tags are <b>public</b>. Everyone will be able to see them!</li>
<li>Keep your tags brief.</li>
<li>We provide a few example tags for you. Use them if you like.</li>
<li>Don't forget to click 'Tag' to save your tags.</li>
<li>Tags must be all-lowercase, no spaces or punctuation. Numbers can  
appear but can't be first. Smoosh them up: for "Web 2.0", tag  
"web20". Max 64 chars.</li>
<li>Don't use plurals.  It's "harddrive", not "harddrives", etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're excited about this, and see huge potential for this system.
 From user feedback on articles, to comment moderation, the system is
really limited only by your participation, and our database hardware!

<h2>Are tags objective or subjective? Can I use any tag I want?</h2>

<p>Other tagging systems let users make up any tags they want, and
punt on the issue of objective meaning. So the tag "foo" means for each
user whatever they want it to mean, and to the system it means nothing
at all, it's just an identifier.</p>

<p>We're going to build the next generation of moderation on top of
tags. That means we're going to poach your namespace. Some tags will
have a substantive effect on the system right from the start (or very
soon).  Today, our article tagger knows about tags like "dupe" or  
"typo".
When we roll out tagging on comments, we will teach it "troll" and
"informative".  These tags can have a meaning in the system.

<p>We expect that <em>you</em> will come up with ways of using tags
that <em>we</em> haven't anticipated.  We plan to start with the
<a href="com-mod.shtml#cm2500">existing ten adjectives</a>
in our current system, but as new tags come into usage, we will
start incorporating them into the system.

<p>Of course, this can work both ways: Tags elsewhere
are your own personal playground and nobody cares if you mess around. On
Slashdot, abusive uses of tags could have negative consequences.   
Precisely what that means, we don't know yet.
</p>

<p>Yes, that's pretty arbitrary. We'll spell out policy as this evolves.
For now, the deal is: tag in good faith, and if there's abuse, we'll
deal with it in good faith.  </p>
