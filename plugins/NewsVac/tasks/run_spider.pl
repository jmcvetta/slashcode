# SlashD Task (c) OSDN 2001
#
# Description: Performs Spidering runs within Task architechture.
# 	       Converted from original cron jobs from NewsForge
# 	       1.0 production site.
#
# Task Options:
# 
# 	spiders = COMMA separated list of spiders to run. No time checks are
# 		  performed, and no times are written to the database. This 
# 		  behavior may change in the future.
#
#	disable_template_cache = If set and non-zero (boolean), then this 
#	forces the template cache off. This causes a serious hit on
#	performance and should not be used unless you REALLY know what you are
#	doing.
#
#	iterations = If the spiders option is not given, this value
#	represents the maximum number of spiders that will be run during this
#	execution.
