=head1 TODO

=head2 Check Classes

The default failure value is DEATH, rather than FATAL, which is non-fatal:
callers can choose to re-display the form on FAILURE, whereas with DEATH
there's no reason to continue, but one must start over with a new form (if
indeed even that).

=over 4

=item User (DONE)

Admins can be skipped on these checks with a var.  Simple checks for:

=over 4

=item karma

=item seclev

=item is_subscriber

=item is_admin

=back


=item Duration

We need to implement limit modulation.

=over 4

=item min duration between uses (DONE)

FAILURE

=item min duration betwen creation and use (DONE)

FAILURE

=item max num of uses per time period (DONE)

FAILURE

=item max touches per reskey (NA)

DEATH

Not doing now, if ever.  But will add if we feel a need.

=item max simultaneous reskeys (NA)

FAILURE

I don't think this is necessary, since we've worked out some atomicity problems.

If we do: report error, or invalidate old reskeys?  Which ones?

=back


=item HumanConf

Still needs implementation.


=item AL2 (DONE)

=over 4

=item NoPost

This user cannot post.

=item NoPostAnon

This user cannot post anonymoously.

=item AnonNoPost

This user is anonymous -- or is posting anonymously -- and the anonymous user
cannot post.

=back



=item Proxy Scan (DONE)

Simple wrapper around the proxy scan code.


=item ACL (DONE)

If an ACL required, make sure user has it (is_admin bypasses this check (by default)).

If an ACL prohibits access, make sure user does NOT have it (no bypass).


=item POST (NA)

Probably best handled in .pl as we always have, though we could move it if we
felt a need.


=back
