=head1 NAME

Slash::Subscribe - Let users buy adless pages

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Slash::Subscribe;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin lets users purchase adless pages at /subscribe.pl, with
built-in (but optional) support for using Paypal.

Understanding its code will be easier after recognizing that one of its
design goals was to distinguish the act of "paying for" adless pages,
in which money (probably) trades hands, from the act of "buying," in
which adless pages are actually viewed.  After "paying for" a page, you
can still get your money back, but after you "bought" it, no refund.
