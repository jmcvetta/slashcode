Just some notes on a rewrite I was thinking about. This may give you a headache 
if you read it. Zoo stuff is just a wee bit complicated :)
This would not work with the current schema because we would never know who
created the relationship in FOF/EOF (which is something we need to know). Might 
mean splitting up the tables which wouldn't be the worst thing to happen (and in all honesty
might make this a little more workable).
