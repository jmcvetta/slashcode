<H1>Either your network or ip address has been banned
from this site</H1><BR>
due to script flooding that originated
from your network or ip address
-- or this IP might have been used to post comments designed to break
web browser rendering.
If you feel that this is unwarranted, feel free to include your IP address
(<b>[% ip %]</b>) in the subject of an email, and we will examine why
there is a ban. If you fail to include the IP address (again,
<em>in the subject!</em>), then
your message will be deleted and ignored. I mean come on,
we're good, we're not psychic.
