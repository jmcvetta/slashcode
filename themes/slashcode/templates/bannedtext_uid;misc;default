<BODY BGCOLOR="pink">
<H1>Your user account has been banned from [% constants.sitename %]</H1><BR>
Due to questionable activity from this user account, it has been
temporarily disabled.  Actions that would cause this ban are posting
comments designed to intentionally break comment rendering for other
users, or running some sort of script or program that loaded an
unacceptable number of pages in a short time frame.
<p>If you feel that this is unwarranted, feel free to include your UID
(<b>[% user.uid %]</b>) in the subject of an email, and we will examine why
there is a ban. If you fail to include the UID (again,
<em>in the subject!</em>), then
your message will be deleted and ignored. I mean come
on, we're good, we're not psychic. Send your email to
<a href="mailto:[% constants.adminmail | strip_attribute %]">[% constants.adminmail %]</a>.
