[% constants.siteadmin_name.uc %]!</B> <P>What follows are random
moderations performed on comments in the last few weeks on [% constants.sitename %].
You are asked to <B>honestly</B> evaluate the actions of the moderator of each
comment. Moderators who are ranked poorly will cease to be eligible for
moderator access in the future.

<UL>

<LI>If you are confused about the context of a particular comment, just
link back to the comment page through the parent link, or the #XXX cid
link.</LI>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE="5">Duplicates are fine</FONT></B> (Big because over
<B>100</B> people have emailed me to tell me about this even though it is
explained <B>right here</B>.)  You are not moderating a "Comment" you
are moderating a "Moderation".  Therefore, if a comment is moderated
more than once, it can appear multiple times below.  Don't worry about it.</LI>

<LI>If you are unsure, feel free to leave it unchanged.</LI>

<LI>Please read the <A HREF="[% constants.rootdir %]/moderation.shtml">Moderator Guidelines</A>
and try to be impartial and fair.  You are not moderating to make your
opinions heard, you are trying to help promote a rational discussion.
Play fairly and help make [% constants.sitename %] a little better for everyone.</LI>

<LI>Scores and information identifying the posters of these comments have been
removed to help prevent bias in meta moderation. If you really need to know,
you can click through and see the original message, but we encourage you not
to do this unless you need more context to fairly meta moderate.<BR><BR></LI>

<LI>Today, you have [% comments.size %] moderations to meta-moderate.</LI>
