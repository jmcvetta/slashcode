[% CASE 'mailpasswd_msg' %]

Your new password is [% newpasswd %].  Your old password will still work until
this password is used.  Go to the URL below to log in:

[% constants.absolutedir %]/index.pl?op=userlogin&upasswd=[% newpasswd %]&unickname=[% tempnick %]

Make sure you then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!

Thanks

[% CASE 'userinfo_msg' %]

<P>This is <B>your</B> User Info page.  There are thousands more, but this one is yours.
You most likely are not so interested in you, and probably would be most interested in
clicking the "Edit User Info" and "Customize..." links you see up top there so you can
customize [% constants.sitename %], change your password, or just click pretty widgets to kill time.

[% CASE 'saveuser_email_msg' %]
	The user account [% nickname %] on [% constants.sitename %] had this email
	associated with it.  A web user from [% env.remote_addr %] has
	just changed it to [% realemail %].

	If this is wrong, well then we have a problem.  MOST LIKELY THIS IS NO
	BIG DEAL.  It probably means you have a common nickname and someone else
	wanted it.  They do not have your password, they are not going to sneak
	up on you late at night and steal your children.  Only this email address
	got this email.  So do not sweat it unless your account suddenly dies
	or something.

[% CASE 'cookiemsg' %]
	<P>Your browser didn't save a cookie properly. This could mean you are behind a filter that
	eliminates them, you are using a browser that doesn't support them, or you rejected it.

[% CASE 'dispform_login_msg_1' %]
	Danger, Will Robinson!  You didn't login!  You apparently put
	in the wrong password, or the wrong nickname, or else space
	aliens have infested the server.  I'd suggest trying again,
	or clicking that mail password button if you forgot your password.

[% CASE 'dispform_login_msg_2' %]
	Logging in will allow you to post comments as yourself.  If you
	don't login, you will only be able to post as [% constants.anon_name %].

[% CASE 'dispform_login_msg_3' %]
	Logging in will allow you to post comments as yourself.  If you
	don't login, you will only be able to post as [% env.anon_name %].

[% CASE 'dispform_new_msg_1' %]
	If your registration attempt is failing, it is most likely because
	you tried to register with a <B>duplicate nickname</B>, a <B>duplicate
	email address</B>, or an <B>invalid email</B>.  You can try another below,
	or use the form on the left to either login, or retrieve your forgotten password.

[% CASE 'dispform_new_msg_2' %]
	What? You don't have an account yet?  Well, enter your preferred
	<B>nick</B> name here:

[% CASE 'mailpasswd_mailed_msg' %]
	Passwd for [% name %] was just emailed.<BR>

[% CASE 'mailpasswd_notmailed_msg' %]
	Nickname was not found. No Password was mailed.<BR>

[% CASE 'checklist_msg' %]
	You selected too many options<BR>

[% CASE 'savename_msg' %]

	<P>Saving [% name %]<BR><P>

[% CASE 'savenickname_msg' %]
	<P>Saving [% nickname %].

[% CASE 'changeemail_msg' %]
	Notifying [% realemail %] of the change to their account.

[% CASE 'saveuser_passchanged_msg' %]
	Password changed.

[% CASE 'saveuser_passnomatch_msg' %]
	Passwords don't match. Password not changed.

[% CASE 'saveuser_passtooshort_msg' %]
	Password is too short and was not changed.
